** OVERVIEW **

Open the attached web page (index.html). The page is fixed at 840px wide. Do 
your best to make it fit appropriately at any screen size. We have included 
a wireframe that demonstrates how the design should work on small screens. 
This exercise should take 4-6 hours to complete. 

You may implement the design however you want, but be prepared to justify your
decisions. If you have any questions about this exercise, please contact 
Jay Forbes (jay@o3world.com) for clarification.



** INSTRUCTIONS **


*** At a minimum, your solution should ***

1. Fit appropriately across a variety of screen sizes

2. Implement the small screen layout as demonstrated in `mobile-wireframe.pdf`. 
   Your small screen solution should include a "toggle" menu and modified
   layout for the lower section. You will find image assets at various sizes 
   in the `images` directory. 

3. Demonstrate your knowledge of front end development. Show us what you can do!


*** Advanced work ***

Finished the layout update? Try implementing an image swap function:

1. When you click one of the lower images, that image should move to the top hero 
   spot and the current hero image should move to the image location you just clicked.

2. Implement this functionality however you want, but be prepared to explain your 
   decisions. 
   
   
*** Submitting your work ***

1. Create a new repo call "o3-fe-exercise" on GitHub (https://github.com/). Post your
   code to this repo. 

2. If you do not have an account on GitHub, you can create a free personal acccout
   (see https://github.com/join). 

3. Email the link to your repo to Jay Forbes (jay@o3world.com) and Howie Ross 
   (howie@o3world.com). 
   
   
Good luck!
